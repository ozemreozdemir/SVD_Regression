SVD and Regression
=============================
Perform SVD feature decomposition and then linear regression on the crime-community data. 

Remember that this is production level.  You will have to write in logging, functions, and at least one unit test.
Also note that this is NOT total regression, we are doing SVD feature decomposition first, then linear regression on those features 
Please answer the following two questions:

How many SVD features do we need to get a good enough fit?
Report and interpret the adjusted R-squared.
