 How many SVD features do we need to get a good enough fit? 
 The full linear regression of Violent Crimes per Population has the Adjusted R-squared value of 0.795507165097408 which is relatively low 
 From "The Magnitude of the Principal Components" graph it can be seen that the after the first 60th feature, we are not adding any predictive power
 Results show that at least  81  number of SVD features are needed to get a good enough fit (R-square > 0.8)
 which gives the Adjusted R-squared value of 0.791853188667282 
 Based on the AIC test  84  number of principle components are needed 
 This value indicates that if we cannot reformulate our linear regression model in a way to get rid of dependence on the independent variables, 
 with SVD we are guarenteed to have every feature independent if we have 84  number of principle components
